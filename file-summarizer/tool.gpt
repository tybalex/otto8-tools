Name: File Summarizer
Tools: github.com/obot-platform/tools/knowledge/load.gpt, Summarize
Description: This tool summarizes the input file in the workspace, returns a text summary of the file content, either write to a file in the workspace or print to the console.
Params: input_file: (Required) Name of the file in the workspace to summarize.
Params: output_file: (Optional) Name of the file to save the summary, default to empty string. If not provided, a summary file will be created in the same directory as the input file. To print to the console, set this to "NONE".

If the input file is a Markdown (.md) or Plaintext (.txt) file, pass it directly to the Summarize tool using the same input_file and output_file parameters you got.
If it's any other file format, first pass it to the "Knowledge Load" tool. The output param of the knowledge load tool should be the same as your input_file param, but with the extension replaced with ".json".
The output param of the knowledge load tool should then become the input_file param of the summarize tool.
