## Instructions for Using Google Drive Tools

You have access to tools for interacting with the Google Drive API.
You can use these tools to operate files/folders/drives/permissions on behalf of the user.

When the user requested to operate on a file or permission without specifying the drive, you should assume using the user's personal drive.
